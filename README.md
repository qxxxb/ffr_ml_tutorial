# FFR ML Tutorial Example Project

This is an example project to show how to use machine learning in context of FFRs.

- `main.ipynb` contains models for linear regression,
logistic regression, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, and k-means
clustering
- `neural_network.ipynb` contains a neural network model
- `FFR_data.csv` is a practice dataset based on this
paper: "Hart, B. N. &amp; Jeng, F.-C. (2021) A demonstration of machine
learning in detecting frequency following responses in American neonates.
Percept Mot Skills, 128(1) 48â€“58. www.doi.org/10.1177/0031512520960390". This
dataset contains six FFR features (FrequencyError, SlopeError,
TrackingAccuracy, SpectralAmplitude, PitchStrength, and RMSAmplitude) and a
target response label (FFR).

This package is developed by the Auditory Electrophysiology Laboratory at Ohio
University. This package is distributed to facilitate learning, but without any
warranty. The user is free to use, modify, and re-distribute this package under
the terms of an MIT license.
